# Getting Started with Juno

Start your journey by [launching](./create-a-satellite.mdx) your first Satellite ‚Äì a feature-packed container for your project.

It gives you full control üîê over authentication, a key-pair datastore (akin to a simple 'database'), file storage, your own serverless functions, and hosting.

It's everything you need to run your app. Zero DevOps, no external resources required.

---

## Integrating Juno into an Existing App

After creating your Satellite, you're ready to put it to use. Follow our [step-by-step guidance](setup-the-sdk) to install the SDK and initialize your app, connecting it to your container.

---

## Starting a brand new project

Are you starting a fresh project? We've got your back.

Whether it's a website, blog, or app, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project with ready-made templates for popular frontend frameworks like Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run:

import { Bash } from "./components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm create juno@latest"
  yarn="yarn create juno"
  pnpm="pnpm create juno"
/>

...and follow the prompts.

---

## Local development

Juno's tooling is designed for local-first development. Whether you're using the Next.js or Vite [plugins](reference/plugins.mdx), or creating a new app with `npm create juno@latest`, your project runs locally by default.

With the provided [emulator](./guides/local-development.mdx), you can build and test your projects in an environment that closely mirrors production, without the need to deploy live until you're ready.

---

## How It Works

Juno is your own self-contained execution space.

No DevOps. No backend boilerplate. No surprise complexity.

You build your frontend using the frameworks you love ‚Äî React, SvelteKit, Next.js, you name it.

Need backend logic? Just drop in a serverless function written in Rust or TypeScript.

Everything gets bundled into a single deployable WebAssembly (WASM) container. One artifact. One push. That's your app. It runs in an unstoppable environment that holds its entire state ‚Äî data, logic, and storage.

And here's the beauty of it: Juno controls nothing.

It has zero access to your code, data, or infrastructure. Everything runs under your ownership. Think of it as the space between self-hosting and the serverless cloud ‚Äî a reimagined model for application development.

You manage your projects and supporting modules ‚Äî themed around space mythology ‚Äî using either a CLI or the Console UI, depending on your workflow.

To strengthen this principle of non-interference, deploys and upgrades can be handled via GitHub Actions if you choose to opt in ‚Äî which themselves can't start or stop your app once it's live.

And during development, the environment mirrors production as closely as possible ‚Äî so you're never caught by ‚Äúbut it worked locally.‚Äù
