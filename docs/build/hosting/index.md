# Hosting

Juno Hosting makes it easy to put your project online: fast, secure, and reliable by default.

Deploy your web applications or static sites directly to a satellite using [GitHub Actions](../../guides/github-actions/index.mdx). Your builds run automatically, so shipping updates feels as simple as pushing code.

Prefer running things locally? You can also use the [CLI](../../guides/manual-deployment.mdx).

## Using your Custom Domain

Want to maintain your unique brand identity? You can use your own domain - like `yolo.com` or `hello.world.com` - instead of the default provisioned address.

This comes with an automatically generated SSL certificate for each domain, ensuring secure connections for your users.
